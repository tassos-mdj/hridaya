        <h1>PRANA VINYASA YOGA</h1>
        <p>PRANA VINYASA¬Æ is a full spectrum (ha-tha) approach to embodying the flow of yoga created by Shiva Rea. 
            It is an evolutionary and empowering method which helps students experience the movements of prane 
            (life force) and explore their energetic bodies through intelligent yoga sequences and movement meditations.</p>

        <p class="biotext">My name is Nastazia Spyridonos and I am a 200 RYT certified Prana Vinyasa Yoga teacher.
            My contact with yoga began in 2017 without knowing that it would completely change my life.
            In 2019, I practiced Prana Vinyasa Flow Yoga for the first time, a system created and spread all over the world to this day by Shiva Rea. Having practiced Hatha and Iyengar yoga, it was only with Prana Vinyasa that I felt truly connected to my body and my emotions while my concentration, strength and flexibility got noticeably improved.
            So during the same year I decided to attend my first 200-hour teacher training, which I completed in 2020. Within 2 years I obtained 2 more certifications in Elemental Prana Vinyasa and I am currently attending the 300-hour teacher training held by Shiva Rea.
            The aforementioned system is the one that combines movement with breathing through you deeply connect with your body and its needs at that given moment and mostly we harmoniously move in a beautiful flow.
            I have been a professional yoga teacher for a year and a half working in groups of one, two or more.
            I enjoy sharing the beautiful, never-ending journey of Yoga, evolving along with my students and helping them connect with their bodies and discover the limitless potential which they might not have known they posess.
            Furthermore, along with yoga, I have come to love walks in nature, literature and winter skiing.</p>
